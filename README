** The following scripts were created to assist with IPv6 only testing. ** 

As an intern at Time Warner Cable, I was giving the task to perform tests to IPv6 only websites.  In particular websites that are part of the World IPv6 Launch community.
Since it tests for IPv6-only websites, you must make sure that your end connection is IPv6 only to get the results you are looking for.  

All scripts run in a Perl environment using the standard packages except for one package that must be installed individually. 

**** MUST INSTALL HTML::TokeParser::Simple PACKAGE IN ORDER TO USE THE HTML TOKENIZER.
